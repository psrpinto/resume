            Memeoirs, is a print-on-demand web application that allows a customer to automatically make a
            book from his emails, which is then printed by a publishing partner and shipped through mail.
            I defined the global architecture of the system, designed the database schema and developed the
            HTML5 frontend using Backbone.js, RequireJS, jQuery and SCSS. I also implemented the
            backend, which revolves around an assynchronous AMPQ-based task queue, using
            PHP/Symfony2, Java and SQL. OAuth, IMAP and Payment backend integration. Deployment
            using Capistrano.

            OWI is a software startup that implements email management systems for companies with heavy customer support infrastructures.
            Under the guidance of the systems architect I specified, designed and implemented the webbasedback-office using J2EE and JavaScript. Additionally I implemented the reporting and statistics module using Java and SQL. I also participated in porting the unitary prototype of the backend into a multi-threaded and scalable architecture using C+ + and I developed GUI client applications using wxWidgets.
